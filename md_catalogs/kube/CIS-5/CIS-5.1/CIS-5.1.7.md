# CIS-5.1.7 - \[RBAC and Service Accounts\] Avoid use of system:masters group

## Control Statement

The special group `system:masters` should not be used to grant permissions to any user or service account, except where strictly necessary (e.g. bootstrapping access prior to RBAC being fully available)

## Control rationale_statement

The `system:masters` group has unrestricted access to the Kubernetes API hard-coded into the API server source code. An authenticated user who is a member of this group cannot have their access reduced, even if all bindings and cluster role bindings which mention it, are removed.

When combined with client certificate authentication, use of this group can allow for irrevocable cluster-admin level credentials to exist for a cluster.

## Control impact_statement

Once the RBAC system is operational in a cluster `system:masters` should not be specifically required, as ordinary bindings from principals to the `cluster-admin` cluster role can be made where unrestricted access is required.

## Control remediation_procedure

Remove the `system:masters` group from all users in the cluster.

## Control audit_procedure

Review a list of all credentials which have access to the cluster and ensure that the group `system:masters` is not used.
