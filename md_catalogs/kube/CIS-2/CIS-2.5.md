# CIS-2.5 - \[etcd\] Ensure that the --peer-client-cert-auth argument is set to true

## Control Statement

etcd should be configured for peer authentication.

## Control rationale_statement

etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster.

## Control impact_statement

All peers attempting to communicate with the etcd server will require a valid client certificate for authentication.

## Control remediation_procedure

Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameter.

```
--peer-client-cert-auth=true
```

## Control audit_procedure

Run the following command on the etcd server node:

```
ps -ef | grep etcd
```

Verify that the `--peer-client-cert-auth` argument is set to `true`.

**Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable.
