None

## Control remediation_procedure

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```
chown root:root <proxy kubeconfig file>
```

## Control audit_procedure

Find the kubeconfig file being used by `kube-proxy` by running the following command: 

```
ps -ef | grep kube-proxy
```

If `kube-proxy` is running, get the kubeconfig file location from the `--kubeconfig` parameter. 

To perform the audit:
