# CIS-4.1.2 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `kubelet` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```
chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf
```

## Control audit_procedure

Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the <PATH>/<FILENAME> of the kubelet service config file.

Please set $kubelet_service_config=<PATH><filename> based on the file location on your system 

for example:
```
export kubelet_service_config=/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf
```

To perform the audit manually:
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```
stat -c %U:%G /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
```
Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
