# CIS-4.1.9 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] If the kubelet config.yaml configuration file is being used validate permissions set to 600 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

Run the following command (using the config file location identied in the Audit step)

```
chmod 600 /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

## Control audit_procedure

Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the <PATH>/<FILENAME> of the kubelet config yaml file.

Please set $kubelet_config_yaml=<PATH><filename> based on the file location on your system 

for example:
```
export kubelet_config_yaml=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

```

To perform the audit manually:
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```
stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.

Apply data access control lists, also known as access permissions, to local and remote file systems, databases, and applications.;TITLE:Protect Information through Access Control Lists CONTROL:v7 14.6 DESCRIPTION:Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.;
