# CIS-1.1.8 - \[Control Plane Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the etcd pod specification file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. etcd is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```

## Control audit_procedure

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
