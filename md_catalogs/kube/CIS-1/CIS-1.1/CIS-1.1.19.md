# CIS-1.1.19 - \[Control Plane Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

## Control remediation_procedure

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
chown -R root:root /etc/kubernetes/pki/
```

## Control audit_procedure
