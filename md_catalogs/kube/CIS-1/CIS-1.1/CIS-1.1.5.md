## Control Statement

Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the Scheduler service in the master node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
