# CIS-1.3.7 - \[Controller Manager\] Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1

## Control Statement

Do not bind the Controller Manager service to non-loopback insecure addresses.

## Control rationale_statement

The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter

## Control audit_procedure

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
```

Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1

## Control additional_information

Although the current Kubernetes documentation site says that `--address` is deprecated in favour of `--bind-address` Kubeadm 1.11 still makes use of `--address`
