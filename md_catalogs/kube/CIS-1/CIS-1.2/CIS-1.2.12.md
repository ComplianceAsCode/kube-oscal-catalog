# CIS-1.2.12 - \[API Server\] Ensure that the admission control plugin SecurityContextDeny is set if PodSecurityPolicy is not used

## Control Statement

The SecurityContextDeny admission controller can be used to deny pods which make use of some SecurityContext fields which could allow for privilege escalation in the cluster. This should be used where PodSecurityPolicy is not in place within the cluster.

## Control rationale_statement

SecurityContextDeny can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not have PodSecurityPolicies enabled.

## Control impact_statement

This admission controller should only be used where Pod Security Policies cannot be used on the cluster, as it can interact poorly with certain Pod Security Policies

## Control remediation_procedure

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to include `SecurityContextDeny`, unless `PodSecurityPolicy` is already in place.

```
--enable-admission-plugins=...,SecurityContextDeny,...
```

## Control audit_procedure

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `SecurityContextDeny`, if `PodSecurityPolicy` is not included.

TITLE:Leverage Vetted Modules or Services for Application Security Components CONTROL:v8 16.11 DESCRIPTION:Leverage vetted modules or services for application security components, such as identity management, encryption, and auditing and logging. Using platform features in critical security functions will reduce developersâ€™ workload and minimize the likelihood of design or implementation errors. Modern operating systems provide effective mechanisms for identification, authentication, and authorization and make those mechanisms available to applications. Use only standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed encryption algorithms. Operating systems also provide mechanisms to create and maintain secure audit logs.;TITLE:Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services CONTROL:v7 9 DESCRIPTION:Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services;
