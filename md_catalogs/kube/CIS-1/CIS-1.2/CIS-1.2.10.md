# CIS-1.2.10 - \[API Server\] Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set

## Control Statement

Do not allow all requests.

## Control rationale_statement

Setting admission control plugin `AlwaysAdmit` allows all requests and do not filter any requests.

The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers.

## Control impact_statement

Only requests explicitly allowed by the admissions control plugins would be served.

## Control remediation_procedure

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and either remove the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter, or set it to a value that does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.

## Control audit_procedure

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that if the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set, its value does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.
