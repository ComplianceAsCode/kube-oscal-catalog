# CIS-1.2.13 - \[API Server\] Ensure that the admission control plugin ServiceAccount is set

## Control Statement

Automate service accounts management.

## Control rationale_statement

When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the `default` service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens.

## Control impact_statement

None.

## Control remediation_procedure

Follow the documentation and create `ServiceAccount` objects as per your environment. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and ensure that the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter is set to a value that does not include `ServiceAccount`.

## Control audit_procedure

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--disable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that does not includes `ServiceAccount`.
